# 📚 Digital Library - Backend

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Digital Library, a project created to modernize and organize our neighborhood library! In a world where technology is transforming all aspects of our lives, our mission is to provide the library with an efficient and modern system to manage its collection. This platform will allow the library to be organized, efficient, and accessible to its users, all while preserving the magic of books and knowledge.

Our goal is to empower the library administrator by providing a system that enables them to add, update, delete, and search for books in a simple and convenient way through a web interface.

With a constantly growing collection and the need to serve a diverse community, this system will ensure the library continues to grow and thrive. From cataloging new books to managing popular searches by title, author, or genre, this backend system will be the central infrastructure to meet the library’s future needs.

## 🏆 Objective

The library in our neighborhood wants to modernize and needs a web platform to organize its books. With an updated inventory, the administrator will be able to manage loans and services more efficiently. The system will allow:

- Add books
- Update books
- Delete books
- View books
- Search books by specific attributes
